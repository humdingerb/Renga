- Re-Enable bookmarks2 if server advertise support for it
- Rework bookmark2 code to remove its separate PubSub manager

Delay between logon and getting MUC history? Is it my fault?
MUC replay don't show messages from me, is it expected?
Roster list is not properly resizable
No "writing" notifications
Show avatars for MUC rooms in roster, how does that work?
	Probably we don't want them in the roster, wastes too much space
	or maybe very small 16x16px versions?
Selection message in roster triggers a bit too easily (on right click for popup menu for example)
Make roster headers not selectable
Show nicknames in Roster (see "modern xmpp" recommendations on how to get them)
Manage own nickname in MUC properly

Rename "channel name" and default to nickname

User registration / Captcha forms / Media
=========================================

- In case no form is received, handle legacy fields? Is there a server still needing that?
- Display the OOB data when there is some (below the form? or above? display it and decide depending on what's in it)
- Test with more servers? Is there an XMPP2020 compliant servers list?

Cleanup
=======

Replace JRoster with gloox::RosterManager
Replace UserID with gloox JID and RosterItem
Move things out of Jabberspeak and TalkManager
Move useful things outside of jabber/ directory
Remove TalkManager, have each chat view register as a handler for its sessions/mucroom directly instead.
Have separate constructors for group and normal TalkViews (maybe separate classes, even? some methods are exclusive).

Inconsistent sizing of input field (because of send button size constraint?)

New features
============

vcard / avatars
	in talk window, see what would make a nice UI for that (focus on groupchats?)
		Maybe not so great idea after all, it wastes some space
		See how Discord does it (only on first message or something) but doesn't go too well on wide screens...
	If we use avatars to identify users in groupchats, we probably need an identicon or something like it for users without an avatar, too
		Something that looks like human portraits would be nice? Not a fan of traditional identicons
			See David Revoy's set of bird and cat avatars, maybe we can use that?
		But in MUC we don't get to know the bare JID of other people taking part, so we would do it on the nickname.
		There is a XEP defining how to assign colors to users so that different clients use the same colors
	Support for setting own vcard and/or avatar and showing it somewhere
	Export/import people files from vcard data

BNotification on all messages from single user
BNotification on XEP-0372 mentions (not in wide use). Also send XEP-0372 mentions whenever the user uses a tab-completed nickname when we implement that

MUC
===

Group MUCs by server in Roster instead of a single "Group Chats" list
	XMPP is thinking about discord-like grouping of MUCs, maybe wait for that instead
	Also group by IRC servers for biboumi MUCs

- Discovering the conference server associated with the user's server
- Listing existing rooms (in the associated conference server and in others)
	May need result set management?
- Creating a room
- Showing availability (away)
- Changing nickname
- Private messages (send and receive)
- Invitations
- Message to all
- Set subject
- Kick
- Voice/unvoice
- Getting extended room info (logs url, number if users) without joining
- Logging people entering/leaving the room (optionally?) + collapsing successive join/leave messages?
- Viewing full JID in non-anonymous rooms (and allowing to add them to the roster)
- Warn user when entering a non-anonymous room

- Error handling (entering member only room, ...)
