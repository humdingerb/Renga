An instant messaging client for Haiku, connecting to the XMPP network.

Features
========

Renga is still a quite simple and limited client, a lot of the features you'd
expect from an instant messaging client (nickname highlight, typing notifications,
...) are currently missing. We're adding them one at a time.

XMPP technical details
----------------------

This client implements core compliance, core client features. However it does
not implement much of the IM compliance, yet. See issue [#47](https://github.com/HaikuArchives/Renga/issues/47) for a more detailed
tracking. Oh, and we have a **doap.xml**, too!
