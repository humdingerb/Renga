Features
========

Renga is still a quite simple and limited client, a lot of the features you'd
expect from an instant messaging client (avatars, typing notifications, ...)
are currently missing. We're adding them one at a time.

XMPP technical details
----------------------

This client implements core compliance, core client features. However it does
not implement much of the IM compliance, yet. See issue #47 for a more detailed
tracking. Oh, and we have a doap.xmp, too!
